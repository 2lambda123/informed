### Changed
**
Note: this was the first release but i wanted to include changes from
`react-form` so here they are:
**

- `formApi` was split into two parts `formApi` ( contains just functions ) `formState` ( contains just form state )
- Form level validation will only occur if all field level validation passes. It used to always execute both.
- `defaultValues` Form prop is now called `initialValues`
- `onChange` Form prop only recieves the `formState`
- `preventDefault` Form prop is now `dontPreventDefault`
- `getApi` Form prop just returns the formApi, not the state and the api


### Removed
**
Note: this was the first release but i wanted to include things that were removed from
`react-form` so here they are:
**

- `NestedField` you can use `Scope` instead but all it does is scope internal fields to `scope="your-scope"`
- validateOnSubmit was removed. Now the form always validates on submit by default and you can opt into sooner validation at field level
- `defaultValues` form prop is now called `initialValues`
- `pure` Form prop. Its not needed anymore due to the use of `React.PureComponent` internally
